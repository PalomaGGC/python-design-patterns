# Python Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Python Design Patterns Repository! This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns in Python. The design patterns included here are classified into three categories:

## Creational Design Patterns
1. **Abstract Factory:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
2. **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   
## Structural Design Patterns
3. **Adapter:** Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
4. **Composite:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
5. **Decorator:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
   
## Behavioral Design Patterns
6. **Mediator:** Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
7. **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

Each design pattern example comes with detailed explanations and code samples to help you understand their implementation in Python. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository!

## How to Use
You can navigate to the respective folders for each design pattern to find the Python code examples and explanations.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more design patterns, improve existing code samples, or fix issues, please open a pull request.

Happy coding!
